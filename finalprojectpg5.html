				<div id="bassoonInfo">
					<p> I began playing bassoon my freshman year of High School and it has been the best decition
					I have ever made in my life. I began on bassoon teaching myself but I did take a few lessons from <a href="http://www.cwreeds.com/" title="Dr.Wickham">Dr. 
					Christopher Wickham</a> from Rudgers University.</p>

					<p>Bassoon Life -- My college essay</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
					If you don’t know what a bassoon is, believe me, you are not alone. No, it is not an oboe, or an english horn, but an instrument of its own merit. With a range just above three octaves, it breaks the clef barrier that is often found in other instruments and is believed to be among one of the hardest instruments to master. I, like all other bassoonists, began my journey sounding exactly like a dying cat. I was bad, I knew it, and everyone around me knew it too. It was the constant feeling of failure, however, that drove me to be better. 
					It wasn’t until I had my first lesson with Dr. Wickham that I learned the limitless potential of the bassoon. His sound was amazing and I was determined to emulate it. I wanted my sound to be like a dark wood; not ostentatious, but when you heard it, it was sublimely modest. I searched for a classic  sound, like the reticent beauty of a ballerina twirling on stage. This was a pivotal moment in my musicianship because it yielded a set marker of sound that I could aspire towards. At this point in my musical journey, being awful ceased being a death sentence and became inspiration to further pursue achieving gratifying sound. 
					The best musician I know is my brother. He plays bassoon, bass, the cello, and many more instruments. He is my musicianship role model. Not only does he practice everyday and bring an instrument everywhere he goes but he also immerses what seems to be his entire being into every note he plays! I’m not that musically mature yet but I am reaching for that musical sophistication; a level where I join a jam session and not worry about the mistakes I make because the mistakes have waxed into aspired sound! 
					</p>
					<p>
					I know I’ve evolved when I play. I hear the dark mahogany sound that reminds me of Dr. Wickham’s as it exits my bassoon. I’m not worried that I may mess up because I’m in the moment, in the music! Eventually, I’ll fix it. 
					</p>
					<p>
					I know that the more I practice and work on my sound, the less I’ll mess up. Silly mistakes will stop being silly mistakes and evolve into anomalies. I’ll develop a better ear to hear issues with my sound and technique I’ll go on growing as a musician.
